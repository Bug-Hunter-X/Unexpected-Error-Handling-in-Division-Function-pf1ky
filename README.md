# Unexpected Error Handling in Division Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when performing division:  improper handling of zero and NaN values.  The `bug.js` file shows the faulty function, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The original function fails when dividing by zero or NaN, throwing errors or returning unexpected results. The improved version uses robust checks and returns meaningful results in these cases.
